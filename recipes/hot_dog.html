        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hot Dogs (Franks/Wieners)</li>
            <li>Hot Dog Buns</li>
            <li>Butter or Oil</li>
            <li>Souce/s</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the Pan: Place the frying pan on the stove over medium heat. Add about 1 teaspoon of butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Sear the Franks: Once the butter is melted or the oil is shimmering, carefully place the hot dogs in the pan.</li>
            <li>Turn and Brown: Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, using tongs to turn the hot dogs frequently. You want a nice brown sear and for the hot dogs to be heated completely through.</li>
            <li>Remove: Take the cooked hot dogs out of the pan and set them on a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb any excess grease.</li> 
            <li><b>Assemble:</b> Place one hot dog securely into the middle of each warm bun.</li>
            <li><b>Top:</b> Squeeze a zigzag of mustard over the hot dog. Add ketchup and/or relish as desired.</li>
            <li><b>Serve</b> immediately and enjoy!</li>           
        </ol>
