        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <div class="list_ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>Hot Dogs (Franks/Wieners)</li>
                <li>Hot Dog Buns</li>
                <li>Butter or Oil</li>
                <li>Souce/s</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the Pan: Place the frying pan on the stove over medium
                heat. Add about 1 teaspoon of butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sear the Franks: Once the butter is melted or the oil is
                shimmering, carefully place the hot dogs in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn and Brown: Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, using tongs to turn the
                hot dogs frequently. You want a nice brown sear and for the hot
                dogs to be heated completely through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove: Take the cooked hot dogs out of the pan and set them on
                a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb any excess grease.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Assemble:</b> Place one hot dog securely into the middle of
                each warm bun.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Top:</b> Squeeze a zigzag of mustard over the hot dog. Add
                ketchup and/or relish as desired.
            </li>
            <li><b>Serve</b> immediately and enjoy!</li>
