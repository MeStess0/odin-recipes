        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <div class="list_ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>Egg</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Seasoning</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="method">
            <ol align="center">
                <li>
                    Use the right pan: pick a good nonstick or well-seasoned
                    cast-iron skillet and clean, dry surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat the pan gently: set the burner to low–medium (aim for
                    no loud sizzling). Add about 1 tablespoon (≈14 g) of butter
                    for one egg and let it melt until it’s foaming but not
                    browned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Crack the egg into a small bowl, then slide it into the
                    butter (this keeps the yolk intact and avoids shell bits).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook low and slow: keep the heat low so the whites set
                    evenly. If you want a runny yolk and soft whites, cover the
                    pan for ~1½–3 minutes until the white is set. For extra-even
                    cooking, spoon melted butter over the top (basting).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finish & season: remove from heat when whites are set to
                    your liking, season with salt and pepper, and serve
                    immediately.
                </li>
            </ol>
