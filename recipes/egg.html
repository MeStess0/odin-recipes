        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Use the right pan: pick a good nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet and clean, dry surface.</li>
            <li>Heat the pan gently: set the burner to low–medium (aim for no loud sizzling). Add about 1 tablespoon (≈14 g) of butter for one egg and let it melt until it’s foaming but not browned.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg into a small bowl, then slide it into the butter (this keeps the yolk intact and avoids shell bits).</li>
            <li>Cook low and slow: keep the heat low so the whites set evenly. If you want a runny yolk and soft whites, cover the pan for ~1½–3 minutes until the white is set. For extra-even cooking, spoon melted butter over the top (basting).</li>
            <li>Finish & season: remove from heat when whites are set to your liking, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.</li>
            
        </ol>
